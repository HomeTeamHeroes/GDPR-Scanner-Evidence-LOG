# GDPR Scanner Evidence Log
This repository contains SHA-256 hashes of HAR (HTTP Archive) evidence files generated by [GDPR Scanner](https://gdprscanner.eu).
## Purpose
Each daily log file contains cryptographic hashes of evidence files. The git commit timestamps provide third-party proof of when each hash was recorded.
## Verification
1. Download your HAR file from GDPR Scanner
2. Compute SHA-256 hash:
   - Windows PowerShell: `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 your-file.har`
   - Mac/Linux: `sha256sum your-file.har`
3. Search this repository for your hash
4. Git commit timestamp proves when the scan was recorded
## File Format
- Files are named `DD-MM-YY.json` (UTC date)
- Each file uses JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line)
### Entry Format
```json
{"scanId":"...","url":"...","harHash":"...","timestamp":"..."}
```
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `scanId` | Internal scan identifier |
| `url` | Scanned website URL |
| `harHash` | SHA-256 hash of the HAR file |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp (UTC) |
## Daily Updates
